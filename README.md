# evlmsync-evernote2onenote-1.3.6
Trying to copy evernote files to OneNote and after unzipping opens to printer selection window
Steps I took:
Followed the link from Google ![1000009940](https://github.com/waytootangled/evlmsync-evernote2onenote-1.3.6/assets/29291296/a5490ee3-7873-43a3-bf7b-28b06e7c9fed)
Downloaded the zip file ![1000009943](https://github.com/waytootangled/evlmsync-evernote2onenote-1.3.6/assets/29291296/bb480db2-53ed-418a-b5d6-624c6ad9bc6c)
Extracted and  unzipped the file

When I clicked on the .exe file, I got a weird print screen.![1000009950](https://github.com/waytootangled/evlmsync-evernote2onenote-1.3.6/assets/29291296/b7bd9571-86c5-4f36-b10c-609723750966)
For kicks I downloaded the source code zip file to see if I could do anything with that.  I have a long history in It but I won't claim to know things I don't know - and I have no idea what to do with the subsequent downloaded source code files.

I also tried to do it through Zapier but there language says "migrate" and I couldn't get through to anyone who could confirm or deny that my Evernote files would be gone.

I have no idea what to do at this point.

Can someone please assist?

Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  With our proposed move to OneNote for better integration, many of my people have personal info along with company info in their evernote account so this is a very important topic to know. 

Thanks so much-
Michelle
